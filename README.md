We assess the internal and external validity of interactive experiments that are conducted with subjects both in the lab and online.  The assessments are based on cheating experiments in which subjects earn real money, are subject to a tax (that is redistributed to other subjects), and can lie about their earnings.  We identify the mode effects that affect internal validity by comparing treatment effects in lab and online versions of the experiments.  Secondly, we compare the treatment effects across different online (MTurk and U.K. CESS Online) and lab subject pools to determine their effect on external validity. For the most part treatment effects are robust across mode and samples.  Nevertheless, we find some features of both mode and subject pool that might affect experimental outcomes.
